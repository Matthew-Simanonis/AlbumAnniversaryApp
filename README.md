# AlbumAnniversaryApp
Will scrape wikipedia HTML to grab Album information (title, artist, release date, URL) and saves to a CSV file. Can also be checked against todays date for anniversaries of album release, and send an email as a reminder.

This is my first "App"

I plan on adding more ways to change the data frame, a way to constantly check once a day, and possibly make accounts with different lists of albums saved.

I would love to hear feedback, the code is probably pretty messy.
